    "application requirements": "To apply, you'll need an online application, official transcripts, two letters of recommendation, a personal statement, a resume (for business programs), and a $60 fee. GRE/GMAT or English proficiency may also be required depending on your program.",
    
    "check application status": "You can check your status anytime by logging into the [application status portal](https://gradapp.stevens.edu/). You'll see updates from both yourself and the admissions office there.",
    
    "admissions decision": "Master's applications are typically reviewed within 3â€“4 weeks. Ph.D. decisions take about 6 weeks after the deadline. Once a decision is made, youâ€™ll get an email notification to check your status portal.",
    
    "official transcript": "An official transcript is one sent directly from your institution in a sealed envelope or via a verified electronic sender. It must include a signature or seal and a certified English translation if needed.",
    
    "stevens graduate transcripts": "If you earned a degree at Stevens before, you donâ€™t need to resubmit your transcripts. Weâ€™ll upload them for you automatically.",

    "funding": "Assistantships are limited and competitive. If youâ€™re not awarded one in your first year, you can still pursue opportunities within your department after you arrive."
