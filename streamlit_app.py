    "admissions decision": "Master's applications are typically reviewed within 3â€“4 weeks. Ph.D. decisions take about 6 weeks after the deadline. Once a decision is made, youâ€™ll get an email notification to check your status portal.",
    
    "official transcript": "An official transcript is one sent directly from your institution in a sealed envelope or via a verified electronic sender. It must include a signature or seal and a certified English translation if needed.",
    
    "stevens graduate transcripts": "If you earned a degree at Stevens before, you donâ€™t need to resubmit your transcripts. Weâ€™ll upload them for you automatically.",
